# Third-party notices

Freenary is distributed under the [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 or later](LICENSE). It contains and depends on third-party software under its own terms. This file records the notices that must travel with a copy of Freenary. The authoritative license of each dependency is the `LICENSE` file inside its package under `node_modules`.

## Vendored source

`packages/ui/src/components` is vendored registry source: it is fetched through the registries listed in `packages/ui/components.json` and then edited in this repository. Two upstreams are reproduced below, and both are MIT, which the AGPL permits Freenary to combine with.

Most of that directory — and almost all of its volume — comes from the `@fluid` registry, which serves [Fluid Functionalism](https://github.com/mickadesign/fluid-functionalism):

## Bundled dependencies

The published `ghcr.io/suiramdev/freenary-server` and `ghcr.io/suiramdev/freenary-web` images carry the **whole** install tree, not a production subset: both Dockerfiles run `bun install` with no production flag and then copy `/app` wholesale into the runner stage (`apps/web/Dockerfile:6-7,24`, `apps/server/Dockerfile:8-9,26`). Build tooling and developer tooling therefore travel with the image.

Each of those packages stays under its own license. The AGPL covers Freenary's own source; shipping separately licensed packages beside it on one image is aggregation, and every license below permits that. A census of the locked tree counts 1025 distinct packages:

| License | Count | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MIT | 877 | React, TanStack, Better Auth, Base UI, Hono, date-fns and most of the rest |
| Apache-2.0 | 51 | Prisma and its engines, and others |
| ISC | 49 | Build and runtime utilities |
| BSD-3-Clause, BSD-2-Clause, 0BSD | 23 | Build and runtime utilities |
| Unlicense, MIT-0, CC0-1.0, `MIT OR CC0-1.0` | 8 | Public-domain-equivalent utilities |
| MPL-2.0 | 4 | `lightningcss` and its platform binaries, build only |
| BlueOak-1.0.0 | 3 | `npm` ecosystem utilities |
| `MIT AND ISC` | 2 | `victory-vendor` and `@visx/vendor`, bundled d3 forks under Recharts |
| `AFL-2.1 OR BSD-3-Clause` | 1 | `json-schema`, through the AI SDK; Freenary takes it under BSD-3-Clause |
| CC-BY-4.0 | 1 | `caniuse-lite`, the browser-support data behind `browserslist`, build only |
| Python-2.0 | 1 | `argparse`, through `js-yaml`, through the `shadcn` CLI |
| EPL-2.0 | 1 | `elkjs`, a graph-layout library inside `@prisma/studio-core`, reached from the `prisma` CLI |
| Remix Icon License 1.0 (Apache-2.0) | 1 | `@remixicon/react` |
| OFL-1.1 | 1 | `@fontsource-variable/inter`, the Inter typeface |

No package in the tree is under the GPL, the AGPL or the SSPL.

Two license terms need a word:

- **EPL-2.0.** The FSF holds it incompatible with the GPL family, so `elkjs` must never be linked into Freenary's own code. It reaches the tree only through the `prisma` CLI, which is a `devDependencies` entry of `packages/db` and is developer tooling: Prisma Studio, not the served application. The image carries it beside Freenary rather than as part of it.
- **CC-BY-4.0.** `caniuse-lite` is a data set consumed at build time. It never reaches the runtime bundles.

Two packages in the locked tree declare no `license` field: `seq-queue` (through `mysql2`, through the `prisma` CLI) and `@lix-js/sdk-darwin-arm64` (an optional macOS-arm64 binary of the Paraglide toolchain, absent from a Linux image).

To regenerate the census, read the `license` field of every installed package. Bun uses an isolated linker here, so the packages live under `node_modules/.bun/` and a top-level `node_modules/*` glob finds only the eleven workspace links. The store also keeps directories from earlier installs, so the census must intersect it with `bun.lock`: a plain glob over the store counts packages the tree no longer holds.

```bash
bun -e '
const lock = await Bun.file("bun.lock").text();
const pattern = /^\s+"[^"]+": \["((?:@[^\/"]+\/)?[^@"]+@[^"]+)"/gm;
const locked = new Set([...lock.matchAll(pattern)].map((match) => match[1]));
const globs = [
  "node_modules/.bun/*/node_modules/*/package.json",
  "node_modules/.bun/*/node_modules/@*/*/package.json",
];
const licenses = new Map();
for (const glob of globs) {
  for (const file of new Bun.Glob(glob).scanSync(".")) {
    const pkg = await Bun.file(file).json().catch(() => null);
    if (!pkg?.name) continue;
    const id = pkg.name + "@" + pkg.version;
    if (locked.has(id)) licenses.set(id, pkg.license ?? "no license field");
  }
}
const counts = new Map();
for (const license of licenses.values()) {
  counts.set(license, (counts.get(license) ?? 0) + 1);
}
const rows = [...counts].sort((a, b) => b[1] - a[1]);
for (const [license, count] of rows) console.log(String(count).padStart(5), license);
'
```
